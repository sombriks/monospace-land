# [Monospace Land][repo]

[Eleventy][11ty] template made with [monospace][mono] and [pug][pug].

And maybe [alpinejs][alpinejs].

## Why

I like monospace

## How to use

This repo is configured as a template, there is a button "use this template"

## Noteworthy

- Configurations and project layout are meant to be as simple as possible.
